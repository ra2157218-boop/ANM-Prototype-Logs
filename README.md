# ANM-Prototype-Logs  
Official Log Repository for the ANM-V1.5 Prototype  
*Parallel R1 Worker Panel • Web-of-Thought Engine • Verifier Traces*

---

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains **real execution logs** from the **Artificial Neural Mesh (ANM-V1.5)** prototype — a modular, multi-model Web-of-Thought (WoT) reasoning system created by **Syed Abdur Rehman**.

These logs serve as **verifiable evidence** for the research paper:

**“ANM-V1.5: Prototype-Stage Multi-Model Reasoning Architecture  
Efficiency, Reliability, and Web-of-Thought Behavior on a Base M2 MacBook Air”**

All logs were generated **locally** on a **MacBook Air M2 (16GB RAM)** using:

- DeepSeek-R1-1.5B (base, unfine-tuned)  
- 4-worker Parallel R1 Panel  
- True-WoT Engine  
- Verifier (Super-Strict Mode)  
- MemoryLLM (Strict Diary Mode)

No cloud compute, no GPUs, and **no fine-tuning** were used.

## 🧪 What These Logs Demonstrate
The logs provide full trace-level visibility into:

### ✔ True Web-of-Thought reasoning  
Multi-step, domain-routed reasoning packets.

### ✔ Multi-specialist cooperation  
GeneralLLM, PhysicsLLM, MathLLM, MemoryLLM, Self-Awareness, etc.

### ✔ Super-strict Verifier decisions  
Hard gating, rejection patterns, approval scoring.

### ✔ Parallel multi-model behavior  
4 isolated R1 instances running simultaneously *inside one ANM cycle*.

### ✔ Learning-From-Mistakes (LFM) responses  
Real lessons generated by LFM via GRE.

### ✔ Deterministic convergence  
Stable end-to-end behavior on complex physics tasks.

## 🔍 How to Read the Logs
Each log contains:

- `router_decision`  
- `specialist_rounds`  
- `wot_engine transitions`  
- `memory_context`  
- `lfm adjustments`  
- `verifier_packet`  
- `verifier_decision`  
- `domain violations (if any)`  
- `panel worker outputs (4× R1)`  
- `full execution trace`  

The logs are saved in **JSON Lines** format for reproducibility.

## 💡 Usage
Researchers and engineers can use these logs to:

- Study WoT orchestration  
- Analyze rule-engine behavior  
- Explore multi-agent reasoning  
- Evaluate architecture vs. model performance  
- Reproduce ANM-V1 behavior on their own hardware
